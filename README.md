# woocommerce-remove-address-fields
A simple plugin to remove additional address and billing fields from the woocommerce checkout, none of which are needed for adult sites or sites selling only downloadable content. It leaves just name, country (optional) and email address fields. You can comment out any fields you want to put back.
